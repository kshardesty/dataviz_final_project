The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find my project that explores the question of changing access to education over time in Haiti. This project includes an analysis based on the Barro-Lee education attainment indicators dataset for Haiti. It includes Barro-Lee indicators for the 15+ and 25+ age groups for both total population and female population. Findings consider changing access to education over time in Haiti, as well as discrepancies in access to education between students identified as female and the rest of the population. 

The sample data visualization below is my favorite because it was the first plot I ever created from scratch in R Studio. While it is a simple plot, I appreciate that it tells a compelling data story. The line graph indicates clearly that the percentage of Haiti’s population with no education at all has declined considerably from 1970 to 2010, suggesting that citizens now have greater access to at least some education. For both age groups considered, female students do appear to lag behind total population.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored a global analysis of various World Bank indicators for poverty, health, and education in 2018. It includes datasets for the poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day, Gini index, percent of population living in slums, life expectancy at birth, and adult literacy rate. Findings consider worldwide extreme poverty characteristics, relationship between income inequality and populations living in slums, and relationship between life expectancy and literacy. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

I include the sample data visualization below as my favorite, not because it is the most visually interesting, but because it represents new capabilities learned, especially in the annotations. This linear regression model compares the indicators for [life expectancy](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=chart) at birth (total years, all population) and [literacy rates](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS?view=chart) for the total adult population age 15+. I grouped the data by region and also included countries grouped in the special classifications of “Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations,” “Heavily Indebted Poor Countries,” and “Least Developed Countries.” As might be expected, the trend line suggests a strong positive correlation between the indicators. The higher the life expectancy, the higher the literacy rate.

## Project 03

This project included two parts. In the first part, I explored methods to create different types of data visualizations (such as plotting text data or exploring the distributions of continuous variables). Using a dataset obtained from FSU’s Florida Climate Center for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for 2022, I recreated four charts that were originally generated using data from 2016. I then created my own plot to explore total precipitation by month in Tampa. In the second part, I practiced visualizing textual data using a dataset of lyrics from the Billboard Top 100 songs for 2015. I examined the most used words and performed a sentiment analysis of the top 10 songs from the dataset. Find the code and report in the `project_03/` folder.


The sample data visualization below is a sentiment analysis of the Billboard Top 10 songs for 2015 using the Bing Lexicon. I was particulary interested in this technique and others for visualizing text data, as it is very applicable to my field. I also found a lot of satisfaction in learning how to manually set the axis tick mark labels to clean up the stripped formatting in the data file.

### Moving Forward

I have learned a great deal in this course, including both practical application and current scholarship that will impact my teaching and research. Data science in general is a fascinating field. I do not know what projects I will specifically pursue yet, but I am more confident now in my ability to apply data visualization techniques to my research. I can also approach teaching visual design from different perspectives to better serve my STEM students.
